# Random Advice App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

I made this app to practice with React. The app uses fetch to call data from an API called Advice Slip JSON. You can find the link to the documentation right here: [Link](https://api.adviceslip.com/).

In the future I would like to add some animations to the quotes in order to make the transitions smoother. Hope you liked it! Any advice or suggestions are welcome.
